# About Me

I am a caffeinated junior Full-Stacker with a lot of passion for coding! I was born and raised on the Caribbean Island known as Aruba ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¼ but currently, I am residing in the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±<br>
I am 28 years old and have moved from my little Island to the big city that is Rotterdam; I'm just a small-town boy living in a big world! Ever since I was a child, I had a fascination with technology and it seemed only fitting that I made my way into coding. The first step to world domination is complete!

QuickBiteQR is a web application that allows restaurants and dining establishments to convert their traditional menus into digital ones, making them easily accessible to customers by scanning a QR code, which is found at every table. The back office features a comprehensive dashboard where staff can view and manage all order data, including details from specific tables. This setup enables employees to track orders, monitor table assignments, and calculate totals efficiently.
